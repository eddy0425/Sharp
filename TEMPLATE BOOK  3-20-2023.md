**K \& S Commodity Specific Template Instructions**

When attempting to attain a proper template and commodity answer within each

Template, please adhere to the following instructions:

1.

Identify the appropriate Criteria Template.

There should be a template for each commodity. For commodities without a criteria template

reference the MISCELLANEOUS Criteria Template. Some commodities may seem to be

applicable to more than one template. Therefore, please see the definitions under Level 1 to

assist in determining whether the commodity is properly categorized within the given template.

Any relevant information will be included in this section. Often times, a list of commodities that

are included in the template will be listed along with those that are specifically excluded. With

those that are excluded, direction is given as to what template is more appropriate. Once the

proper template is found, the level of the template must be followed.

**2.**

Follow the levels with the chart.

Levels are listed to break down each commodity as well as the characteristic traits of the good.

The first level will actually state the commodity and any levels following will be possible

features or qualities the good may possess. Along with the levels there will be definitions to

explain the characteristic traits.

Follow the levels through the chart based on the proper characteristics of the commodity until

an answer has been obtained. Note, there should only be one level that is appropriate for each

commodity at each level (i.e. a commodity made of two materials should only fall under one

material level. The definitions will state if the mixture of both materials is applicable to one

level or if the material should be put in a given level based on the chief or highest content

material of the good.)

If the referenced part meets all the qualities defined in level I, proceed to level 2, then 3, etc.

When the referenced part does not meet one of the definitions, go to the next row of that level

in the criteria template.

**For Customs definitions or certain materials, please reference the provided material**

**definitions list, when determining material specifications**

.

3. Obtain a letter answer and answering the questions for the commodity. Once all levels have

been determined, answer any questions that may be in the necessary part specific data column

and state the commodity and answer (A, B. C, etc.) received. The end result should state the

commodity name, proper letter answer, and the answer to any of the questions asked. For

example, the following answers could be received from the Motors template:

Motor A, 16 W

Motor C, 13 W, no brushes

Motor I, 42 W

**Materials List and Definitions**

**Rubber:**

Rubber means the following products, whether or not vulcanized: natural rubber, cellular

rubber, balata, gutta-percha, guayule. chicle and similar natural gums, synthetic rubber, factice

derived from oils, and such substances reclaimed. Synthetic rubber is defined as:

1.) Unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanization

with Sulphur into non-thermoplastic substances which, at a temperature between 18 °C and 29

°C, will not break on being extended to three times their original length and will return, after

being extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not

greater than one and a half times their original length. For the purposes of this test, substances

necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanizing activators or accelerators, may be added;

the presence of substances \[i.e. emulsifiers or anti-tack agents; small amounts of breakdown

products of emulsifiers; very small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents (generally

for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active agents (generally for

obtaining electropositive rubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-

resisting gents, peptisers, preservatives, stabilizers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-

purpose additives\] is also permitted. However, the presence of any substances not necessary

for the cross-linking, such as extenders, plasticizers and fillers, is not permitted;

2.) Thioplasts (TM); and 3.) Natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics,

depolymerized natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated

synthetic high polymers provided that all the above-mentioned products comply with the

requirements concerning vulcanization, elongation and recovery in (a) above.

Level I: Capacitors

Definition of Level 1: Capacitors

1. Capacitors consist of two conducting surfaces separated by an insulating material (dielectric) e.g. paper, plastic, ceramic,

glass.

2. Capacitors can be used to improve the power factor of AC circuits, to produce phase-shifted currents for rotating fields in

induction motors, to protect electrical contacts from the effects of arcing, for storing and releasing given quantities of

electricity, in oscillating circuits, in frequency filters; and for holding and storing a surge of current, generally used to absorb

unwanted electrical pulses, such as voltage

3. Capacitance can be fixed, vana5le or adjustable (pre-set).

4. This does not cover synchronous motors used for power factor improvement which are often called synchronous capacitors.

Definition of Level 1: Fuses

1. A device that automatically interrupts the current when its intensity or voltage exceeds a certain limit

(preventing circuit overload).

2. Fuses are a device in which a length of fuse wire is incorporated (or can be incorporated) so that, when they are

inserted in the circuit, the fuse wire will melt and thus break the circuit to prevent dangerous current increases.

3. Cartridge fuses consist of a tube containing the fuse wire in contact with metal caps at the ends; other fuses

consist of a base or socket (for incorporation in the line), and a connecting piece (which may be screwed into the

socket or pushed in between spring contacts) on which the fuse wire is mounted.

Optically worked is defined by Customs

as,

"The optical working of glass is usually performed in two stages, viz. the

production of the surfaces to the shape required (i.e., with the necessary curvature, at the correct angle, etc.), and

the polishing of these surfaces. This working consists of grinding the surfaces by means of abrasives, rough at first,

then gradually finer, the successive operations being roughing, trueing, smoothing and polishing. Finally, in the

case of lenses required to be of an exact diameter, the edges are ground; this is known as the centering and edging

operation. This heading applies only to optical elements of which the whole or part of their surface has been

polished in order to produce the required optical properties. It applies therefore to elements which have been

ground and polished as described above, and also to elements which have been polished after molding. The

heading does not apply to unpolished elements having under one merely one or more of the processes which

precede polishing.

Level 1: Valve

Definition of Level 1: Valve

1. Any mechanical device used to regulate (e.g., start, stop, or direct) the flow of fluids (liquid, viscous or gaseous)

or of solids (e.g., sand).

2. Valves include such devices designed to regulate the pressure or the flow velocity of a liquid or a gas.

3. Valves regulate the flow by opening or closing an aperture (e.g., gate, disc, ball, plug, needle or diaphragm).

They may be opera

�

by hand (by means of a key, wheel, press button, etc.), or by a motor, solenoid, clock

movement, etc., or by an automatic device such as a spring, counterweight, float lever, thermostatic element or

pressure capsule.
